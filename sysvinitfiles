# chkconfig: <startlevellist> <startpriority> <endpriority>

	Required.  <startlevellist> is a list of levels in which
	the service should be started by default.  <startpriority>
	and <endpriority> are priority numbers.  For example:
	# chkconfig: 2345 20 80

# description: <multi-line description of service>

	Required.  Several lines of description, continued with '\'
	characters.  The initial comment and following whitespace
	on the following lines is ignored.

# autoreload: true

	Optional.  If this line exists, the daemon checks its
	configuration files and reloads them automatically when
	they change.

# processname:

	Optional, multiple entries allowed.  For each process name
	started by the script, there should be a processname entry.
	For example, the samba service starts two daemons:
	# processname: smdb
	# processname: nmdb

# config:

	Optional, multiple entries allowed.  For each static config
	file used by the daemon, use a single entry.  For example:
	# config: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
	# config: /etc/httpd/conf/srm.conf

# pidfile:

	Optional, multiple entries allowed.  Use just like the config
	entry, except that it points at pidfiles.  It is assumed that
	the pidfiles are only updated at process creation time, and
	not later.  The first line of this file should be the ASCII
	representation of the PID; a terminating newline is optional.
	Any lines other than the first line are not examined.

# probe: true

	Optional, used IN PLACE of autoreload, processname, config,
	and pidfile.  If it exists, then a proper reload-if-necessary
	cycle may be acheived by running this command:
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/SCRIPT `/etc/rd.d/init.d/SCRIPT probe`
	where SCRIPT is the name of the service's sysv init script.
